# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`scripts/check-version.py` holds the newest released section's heading to the version in
`Cargo.toml`, so a release is one edit to each: rename `[Unreleased]` to the version and
date, and bump `[workspace.package] version` to match.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The Cargo workspace: eight crates under `crates/`, the `district-ai` binary opening
  an empty libadwaita window, and CI (formatting, clippy, tests, the minimum Rust
  version, cargo-deny, zizmor and the public-hygiene scan).
